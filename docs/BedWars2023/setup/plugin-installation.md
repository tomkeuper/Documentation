Installing plugins is easy. 

Download the [BedWars2023.jar](https://github.com/tomkeuper/BedWars2023/releases) file and put it in your `plugins` folder. It is located in the server's folder. Now start the server or restart it if it's already running, and that's it. If you want to continue with setting it up, [click here](creating-arenas) for a tutorial. If you need help, make sure to read the rest of the wiki.

**For a better performance**, please read about [SlimeWorldManager Support](../hooks/swm-hook).
