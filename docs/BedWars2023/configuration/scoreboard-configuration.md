Since we decided to use [TAB](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB) plugin by Neznamy, we support almost all the features they have to offer. Below, you can find some commonly used features.

Make sure to also understand the [limitations](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Feature-guide:-Scoreboard#limitations) of the scoreboard.

### Longer Scoreboard Lines 
Lines without frequently changing placeholders can have a character limit of up to 64 characters (including color codes).
To achieve this, make sure to add `Long|` in front of the longer lines you want to display. Change this in the language files under the scoreboard section.
