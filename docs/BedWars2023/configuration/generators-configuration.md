### Custom Generators Per Arena Group
If you don't know what is an arena group is, read about it [here](../setup/arena-groups).

Creating a custom configuration is really easy. Copy the `Default` configuration path, paste it, and rename `Default` to your desired arena group. We'll use `4v4v4v4` as an example. You can now change those configuration values for your `4v4v4v4` arenas.

````yaml
4v4v4v4:
  iron:
    delay: 2
    amount: 2
    spawn-limit: 32
  gold:
    delay: 6
    amount: 2
    spawn-limit: 7
  diamond:
    tierI:
      delay: 30
      spawn-limit: 4
    tierII:
      delay: 20
      spawn-limit: 6
      start: 360
    tierIII:
      delay: 15
      spawn-limit: 8
      start: 1080
  emerald:
    tierI:
      delay: 70
      spawn-limit: 4
    tierII:
      delay: 50
      spawn-limit: 6
      start: 720
    tierIII:
      delay: 30
      spawn-limit: 8
      start: 1440
