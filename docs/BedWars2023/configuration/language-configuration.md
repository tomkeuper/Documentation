## Scoreboard Configuration

### Creating Custom Scoreboards
You can create custom scoreboards per [arena groups](../setup/arena-groups). So, let's suppose you have an arena group called `4v4v4v4`, then you can create a custom scoreboard for the arenas using this arena group. You can edit the scoreboard for each arena state (waiting, starting, and playing). So let's suppose you want to have a custom playing scoreboard. Just go into the language file, under the `scoreboard` section, and add your arena group name, and under it, the arena status name:
```yaml
scoreboard:
  4v4v4v4:
    playing:
    - "&f&lBED WARS"
    - "&7%bw_date%"
    - ""
    - "%bw_team_1%"
    - "%bw_team_2%"
    - "%bw_team_3%"
    - "%bw_team_4%"
    - ""
    - "&6%bw_server_ip%"
```

### Scoreboard Team Format
You can change the team format by editing the `format-sb-team-generic` path in the language file. By default, it is set to: `%bw_team_color%%bw_team_letter%&f %bw_team_name%: %bw_team_status%`. The plugin will automatically update the placeholders for the team color, letter, name, and status. 

### Scoreboard Placeholders

#### Team Placeholders:
Scoreboard team placeholders are automatically generated with the following format: `%bw_team_{number}%`, where `{number}` is the team number. More info about the format can be found in the [scoreboard configuration](#creating-custom-scoreboards) section. The following placeholders are available for each team:
- `%bw_team_letter%` - shows the team letter.
- `%bw_team_color%` - shows the team color.
- `%bw_team_name%` - shows the team name.
- `%bw_team_status%` - shows the team status. (alive, dead, etc.).

#### Upgrade Placeholders:
Upgrades are divided into tiers; each upgrade will have a corresponding line containing the cost, currency, and tier color; this makes the tier show up as purchased or not. 
All variables mentioned below are gathered from `upgrades.yml`.
- `{tier_x_color}` - changes the color based on whether it was purchased or not.
- `{tier_x_cost}` - shows the cost of the upgrade.
- `{tier_x_currency}` - shows the currency used to buy the upgrade.

When adding a tier to `upgrades.yml`, you should add another line in each of the language files used. and replace the `x` with the corresponding tier number.

Custom Title/ Sub-Title for Arena Countdown
---------
You can add a custom title for a certain second by adding this to the language file `arena-start-countdown-title-[second]`, where `[second]` can be 4, etc. For adding a custom subTitle use this path: `arena-start-countdown-subtitle-[second]`. Available placeholder: `%bw_seconds%`.

Countdown titles and subtitles are shown when the current second is `currentSecond % 10 == 0 || currentSecond <= 5`.
