:::note

If you want different prices per arena group, you should use a server as a single arena (BUNGEE serverType).

:::

Make sure you're using the right material name when changing item materials in this config. If you want to make [custom categories](shop#how-to-create-items-like-the-armor-category), scroll to the bottom of the page.

For a list of materials, sounds, and potions, check the [resources page](../resources).

The following types of armor are supported: Leather, Chainmail, Iron, Diamond, Golden, and Netherite. Please refer to the item list of the version you are using for the correct item names.

### How to create items like the armor category

BedWars2023 provides a configuration called `weight` that can be added under:
```yaml
namehere-category:
    category-content:
      element1:
        content-settings:
          weight: 1
```
If you buy a content from that shop category with weight 2 you won't be able to buy content with lower weight in this category. Like this:
```yaml
armor-category:
    category-content:
      iron:
        content-settings:
          weight: 1
      diamond:
        content-settings:
          weight: 2
```
In this example you'll no longer be able to buy the iron armor after buying the diamond armor.
