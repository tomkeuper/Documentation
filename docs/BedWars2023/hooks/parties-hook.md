## Parties by AlessioDP
**BedWars2023** provides support for [Parties](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/parties-an-advanced-parties-manager.3709/) (by AlessioDP).

If players make a party and then join a BedWars game, BedWars2023 will put them on the same team.

Just install the Parties plugin on the BedWars server, and that's it :smile:. You can additionally 
 configure the minimum party rank allowed to select an arena.
